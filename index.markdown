# Cosmic Cargo
This is my in development project for my sophomore year game project. I am the tech lead of my team of 5. The game is in C++ and uses a custom engine built on top of OpenGL. It is a space ship building battler.
- Created the entity component system the engine is built on
- Serialization with Modern JSON for C++
- Created a debug editor system that uses the JSON object to edit and view properties with just one macro.
- Made the ship system to allow for easy ship creation and modification and turret placement
- Did all the collision detection and resolution with spatial hashing
- Multithreading and other optimizations on everything from collision to particles

# [VCT Predictions Bot](https://github.com/MaxOrtGit/VCT-Predictions-Bot)
This has been my personal project for the past 2 years. It is a Python discord bot made with Pycord for making fake bets on Valorant matches. 
- It has 68 commands that do anything from making a bet to changing a profile's color
- The backend uses SQLAlchemy to store all the data in a SQLite database
- It was hosted at first on Repl.it, then AWS, and now on a Raspberry Pi clone
- It web scrapes a site for the match, team, tournament, and odds data
- It happens all automatically from just the tournament link
- It has a lot of small details like automatically accents with anything for a team's color to a user's color

# Factory Puzzle Game
This was my second semester freshmen year game project. It was a team of 5. I convinced my team to take the opportunity to make the game in C++ instead of C so we were the only team using C++. The game is a puzzle game where you have to fit in machines in a small area to process foods. I made the machine system that allowed for easy creation of new machines with complicated layouts and multiple recipes. I also made the saving system.
